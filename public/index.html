    The %PUBLIC_URL% placeholder in the tags above will be replaced with the URL of the `public` directory during the build process.
    Only files within the `public` folder can be referenced directly from the HTML.

    Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
    work properly with both client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
    For non-root public URL configuration, run `npm run build`.
